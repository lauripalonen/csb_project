FLAW 1: Cross Site Request Forgery
link: TBA

description: 
The application has enabled a CSRF exempt for the requests considering the voting. This allows requests from external sites to our application, exploiting currently authenticated user. If the user visits a malicious site while logged in to our service, the malicous site can make a request while acting as the user.

how to fix:
Disable CSRF_exempt tags from the functions handling the requests and include {% csrf_token %} in the template files that introduces POST requests. Modern frameworks tend to handle CSRF attacks well; to enable this security risk in our application we had to specifically allow the CSRF exempt.
